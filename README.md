# textsentiment

Applying Google sentiment analysis to text messages stored in a mongodb.

This is a partner project to [smsprocessor](https://github.com/johnfyoung/smsprocessor), which takes XML representations of SMS and MMS messages as packaged by the Android app [SMS Backup & Restore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.riteshsahu.SMSBackupRestore&hl=en_US), and stores them in a MongoDB.

This project explores applying Google Cloud API sentiment analysis to text messages stored by the `smsprocessor` project. It requires a Google Cloud API account.
